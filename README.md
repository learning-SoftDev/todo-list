# ToDoList

This is a productivity ToDoList app which uses browsers' local storage for storing of tasks

# Functionalities

- Creating unique projects and tasks which includes the following fields: title of task, due date, details of the task, and if the task is important.
- Editing and deleting of projects and tasks
- Light and Dark Mode UI
- Hiding of side panel
- Displaying of All Tasks, Tasks per Project, Tasks that are due Today and 7 days from now, and Tasks that are marked as Important.
- Validation of unique projects and task titles (given that the duplicate tasks belong to one project) to avoid duplications.
- Marking of tasks as completed and changing the font styles into strikethrough when completed.

# Future Improvements

- Create a registration page and a database to store the tasks so it will be available on every device.
